To further understand hematopoiesis, we have compared gene expression profiles of human erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, B cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes, and monocytes using whole genome microarrays. A bioinformatics analysis of these data was performed focusing on transcription factors, immunoglobulin superfamily members, and lineage-specific transcripts. We observed that the numbers of lineage-specific genes varies by 2 orders of magnitude, ranging from 5 for cytotoxic T cells to 878 for granulocytes. In addition, we have identified novel coexpression patterns for key transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis (eg, GATA3-GFI1 and GATA2-KLF1). This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of gene expression in hematopoietic cells to date and has identified genes that play key roles in lineage commitment and cell function.

In addition, we have identified novel coexpression patterns for key transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis (eg, GATA3-GFI1 and GATA2-KLF1). This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of gene expression in hematopoietic cells to date and has identified genes that play key roles in lineage commitment and cell function.

To further understand hematopoiesis, we have compared gene expression profiles of human erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, B cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes, and monocytes using whole genome microarrays. A bioinformatics analysis of these data was performed focusing on transcription factors, immunoglobulin superfamily members, and lineage-specific transcripts. We observed that the numbers of lineage-specific genes varies by 2 orders of magnitude, ranging from 5 for cytotoxic T cells to 878 for granulocytes. In addition, we have identified novel coexpression patterns for key transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis (eg, GATA3-GFI1 and GATA2-KLF1). This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of gene expression in hematopoietic cells to date and has identified genes that play key roles in lineage commitment and cell function. The data, which are freely accessible, will be invaluable for future studies on hematopoiesis and the role of specific genes and will also aid the understanding of the recent genome-wide association studies.

These ""humanized"" mice are useful models to study human immunology and human-tropic infections, autoimmunity, and cancer. However, some human immune cell subsets are unable to fully develop or acquire full functional capacity due to a lack of cross-reactivity of many growth factors and cytokines between species. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) in mice are categorized into cDC1, which mediate T helper (Th)1 and CD8+ T cell responses, and cDC2, which mediate Th2 and Th17 responses. The likely human equivalents are CD141+ DC and CD1c+ DC subsets for mouse cDC1 and cDC2, respectively, but the extent of any interspecies differences is poorly characterized. Here, we exploit the fact that human CD141+ DC and CD1c+ DC develop in humanized mice, to further explore their equivalency in vivo. Global transcriptome analysis of CD141+ DC and CD1c+ DC isolated from humanized mice demonstrated that they closely resemble those in human blood. Activation of DC subsets in vivo, with the TLR3 ligand poly I:C, and the TLR7/8 ligand R848 revealed that a core panel of genes consistent with DC maturation status were upregulated by both subsets. R848 specifically upregulated genes associated with Th17 responses by CD1c+ DC, while poly I:C upregulated IFN-Œª genes specifically by CD141+ DC. MYCL expression, known to be essential for CD8+ T cell priming by mouse DC, was specifically induced in CD141+ DC after activation.

MYCL expression, known to be essential for CD8+ T cell priming by mouse DC, was specifically induced in CD141+ DC after activation.

In combination, these data demonstrate that humanized mice provide an attractive and tractable model to study human DC in vitro and in vivo.

A;7002	7002	Lindstedt	A	tonsil plasmacytoid dendritic cell 1	Homo sapiens	tonsil pDC	CL:0000784		plasmacytoid dendritic cell			Lindstedt	"Human dendritic cells (DCs) are a distinct but heterogeneous lineage of APCs operating as the link between innate and adaptive immune responses, with the function to either maintain tolerance or trigger immunity. The DC lineage consists of several subpopulations with unique phenotypes; however, their functional characteristics and transcriptional similarities remain largely unknown. To further characterize the phenotypes and transcriptomes of the subsets, we purified myeloid CD16(+), blood DC Ag 1(+) (BDCA1(+)), and BDCA3(+) DC populations, as well as plasmacytoid CD123(+) DCs, from tonsillar tissue and peripheral blood. Transcriptional profiling and hierarchical clustering visualized that BDCA1(+) DCs clustered with BDCA3(+) DCs, whereas CD16(+) DCs and CD123(+) DCs clustered as distinct populations in blood. Differential expression levels of chemokines, ILs, and pattern recognition receptors were demonstrated, which emphasize innate DC subset specialization. Even though highly BDCA1(+) and BDCA3(+) DC-specific gene expression was identified in blood, the BDCA1(+) DCs and BDCA3(+) DCs from tonsils displayed similar transcriptional activity, most likely due to the pathogenic or inflammatory maturational signals present in tonsillar tissues.

Inhalation of LPS has been implicated in the pathogenesis and/or severity of several lung diseases, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Alveolar macrophages are the main resident leukocytes exposed to inhaled antigens. To obtain insight into which innate immune pathways become activated within human alveolar macrophages upon exposure to LPS in vivo, we conducted a study in eight healthy humans, in which we instilled sterile saline into a lung segment by bronchoscope, followed by instillation of LPS into the contralateral lung. Six hours later, a bilateral bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and whole-genome transcriptional profiling was done on purified alveolar macrophages, comparing cells exposed to saline or LPS from the same individuals. LPS induced differential expression of 2,932 genes in alveolar macrophages; 1,520 genes were upregulated, whereas 1,440 genes were downregulated. A total of 26 biological functions were overrepresented in LPS-exposed macrophages; 44 canonical pathways affected by LPS were identified, among which the genes associated with the role of pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and viruses represented the top pathway. Other pathways included cellular immune response, signaling by tumor necrosis factor (receptor) family members, cytokine signaling and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. These results reveal for the first time a large number of functional pathways influenced by the biologically relevant challenge provided by LPS administered into the airways.

However, it has largely failed to identify transcriptional programs that differ between cancer and corresponding normal cells and has not been efficient in identifying expression changes fundamental to disease etiology. Here we present a method that facilitates the comparison of any cancer sample to its nearest normal cellular counterpart, using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a model. We first generated a gene expression-based landscape of the normal hematopoietic hierarchy, using expression profiles from normal stem/progenitor cells, and next mapped the AML patient samples to this landscape. This allowed us to identify the closest normal counterpart of individual AML samples and determine gene expression changes between cancer and normal. We find the cancer vs normal method (CvN method) to be superior to conventional methods in stratifying AML patients with aberrant karyotype and in identifying common aberrant transcriptional programs with potential importance for AML etiology. Moreover, the CvN method uncovered a novel poor-outcome subtype of normal-karyotype AML, which allowed for the generation of a highly prognostic survival signature.

Fluzone, Pneumovax and Gardasil, respectively, activate monocyte-derived DCs, monocytes and CD1c+ blood DCs, highlighting APC specialization in response to vaccines. Finally, the blood signatures from individuals vaccinated with Fluzone or infected with influenza reveal a signature of adaptive immunity activation following vaccination and symptomatic infections, but not asymptomatic infections. These data, offered with a web interface, may guide the development of improved vaccines.

We report in this study a protocol generating both XCR1(+) and XCR1(-) human DC in CD34(+) progenitor cultures (CD34-DC). Gene expression profiling, phenotypic characterization, and functional studies demonstrated that XCR1(-) CD34-DC are similar to canonical MoDC, whereas XCR1(+) CD34-DC resemble XCR1(+) blood DC (bDC). XCR1(+) DC were strongly activated by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid but not LPS, and conversely for MoDC. XCR1(+) DC and MoDC expressed strikingly different patterns of molecules involved in inflammation and in cross-talk with NK or T cells. XCR1(+) CD34-DC but not MoDC efficiently cross-presented a cell-associated Ag upon stimulation by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid or R848, likewise to what was reported for XCR1(+) bDC. Hence, it is feasible to generate high numbers of bona fide XCR1(+) human DC in vitro as a model to decipher the functions of XCR1(+) bDC and as a potential source of XCR1(+) DC for clinical use.

Using microglia isolated from the adult human brain, we demonstrate that myelin phagocytosis is dependent on the polarization state of the cells. Myelin ingestion is significantly enhanced in cells exposed to TGF-Œ≤ compared with resting basal conditions and markedly reduced in classically activated polarized cells. Transcriptional analysis indicated that TGF-Œ≤-treated microglia closely resembled M0 cells. The tyrosine kinase phagocytic receptor MerTK was one of the most upregulated among a select number of differentially expressed genes in TGF-Œ≤-treated microglia. In contrast, MerTK and its known ligands, growth arrest-specific 6 and Protein S, were downregulated in classically activated cells. MerTK expression and myelin phagocytosis were higher in CNS-derived microglia than observed in monocyte-derived macrophages, both basally and under all tested polarization conditions.

Myelin ingestion is significantly enhanced in cells exposed to TGF-Œ≤ compared with resting basal conditions and markedly reduced in classically activated polarized cells. Transcriptional analysis indicated that TGF-Œ≤-treated microglia closely resembled M0 cells. The tyrosine kinase phagocytic receptor MerTK was one of the most upregulated among a select number of differentially expressed genes in TGF-Œ≤-treated microglia. In contrast, MerTK and its known ligands, growth arrest-specific 6 and Protein S, were downregulated in classically activated cells. MerTK expression and myelin phagocytosis were higher in CNS-derived microglia than observed in monocyte-derived macrophages, both basally and under all tested polarization conditions. Specific MerTK inhibitors reduced myelin phagocytosis and the resultant anti-inflammatory biased cytokine responses for both cell types. Defining and modulating the mechanisms that regulate myelin phagocytosis has the potential to impact lesion and disease evolution in multiple sclerosis. Relevant effects would include enhancing myelin clearance, increasing anti-inflammatory molecule production by myeloid cells, and thereby permitting subsequent tissue repair.

Here, we report that human microglial-like cells (iMGLs) can be differentiated from iPSCs to study their function in neurological diseases, like Alzheimer's disease (AD). We find that iMGLs develop in vitro similarly to microglia in vivo, and whole-transcriptome analysis demonstrates that they are highly similar to cultured adult and fetal human microglia. Functional assessment of iMGLs reveals that they secrete cytokines in response to inflammatory stimuli, migrate and undergo calcium transients, and robustly phagocytose CNS substrates. iMGLs were used to examine the effects of AŒ≤ fibrils and brain-derived tau oligomers on AD-related gene expression and to interrogate mechanisms involved in synaptic pruning. Furthermore, iMGLs transplanted into transgenic mice and human brain organoids resemble microglia in vivo.

Susceptibility to infection has been attributed to ‚Äúimmature‚Äù innate monocyte defences, but no studies have assessed global transcriptional responses of neonatal monocytes to these pathogens. Here, we aimed to identify and characterise the neonatal monocyte transcriptional responses to E. coli and S. epidermidis and the role of common modifiers such as gestational age (GA) and exposure to chorioamnionitis (a common complication of preterm birth) to better understand early life innate immune responses. RNA-sequencing was performed on purified cord blood monocytes from very preterm (< 32 weeks GA) and term infants (37‚Äì40 weeks GA) following standardised challenge with live S. epidermidis or E. coli. The major transcriptional changes induced by either pathogen were highly conserved between infant groups and stimuli, highlighting a common extant neonatal monocyte response to infection, largely mediated by TLR/NF-Œ∫B/TREM-1 signalling. In addition, we observed an activated interferon-centred immune response specific to stimulation with E. coli in both preterm and term infants. These data provide novel insights into the functionality of neonatal monocytes at birth and highlight potential pathways that could be targeted to reduce the harmful effects of bacterial-induced inflammation in sepsis. E. coli and S. epidermidis elicit common transcriptional changes in cord monocytes. The common transcriptional response is mediated by TLR/NF-Œ∫B/TREM-1 signalling.

Susceptibility to infection has been attributed to ‚Äúimmature‚Äù innate monocyte defences, but no studies have assessed global transcriptional responses of neonatal monocytes to these pathogens. Here, we aimed to identify and characterise the neonatal monocyte transcriptional responses to E. coli and S. epidermidis and the role of common modifiers such as gestational age (GA) and exposure to chorioamnionitis (a common complication of preterm birth) to better understand early life innate immune responses. RNA-sequencing was performed on purified cord blood monocytes from very preterm (< 32 weeks GA) and term infants (37‚Äì40 weeks GA) following standardised challenge with live S. epidermidis or E. coli. The major transcriptional changes induced by either pathogen were highly conserved between infant groups and stimuli, highlighting a common extant neonatal monocyte response to infection, largely mediated by TLR/NF-Œ∫B/TREM-1 signalling. In addition, we observed an activated interferon-centred immune response specific to stimulation with E. coli in both preterm and term infants. These data provide novel insights into the functionality of neonatal monocytes at birth and highlight potential pathways that could be targeted to reduce the harmful effects of bacterial-induced inflammation in sepsis.

We characterized 29 immune cell types within the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction of healthy donors using RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) and flow cytometry. Our dataset was used, first, to identify sets of genes that are specific, are co-expressed, and have housekeeping roles across the 29 cell types. Then, we examined differences in mRNA heterogeneity and mRNA abundance revealing cell type specificity.

Remarkably, the absence of microbiome in germ-free mice had a time and sexually dimorphic impact both prenatally and postnatally: microglia were more profoundly perturbed in male embryos and female adults. Antibiotic treatment of adult mice triggered sexually biased microglial responses revealing both acute and long-term effects of microbiota depletion. Finally, human fetal microglia exhibited significant overlap with the murine transcriptomic signature. Our study shows that microglia respond to environmental challenges in a sex- and time-dependent manner from prenatal stages, with major implications for our understanding of microglial contributions to health and disease.

Human embryonic stem cell lines KCL001, KCL002, and HUES-2 were differentiated into monocytes by coculture-free differentiation with two growth factors using a three-step method. The method involved embryoid body (EB) formation in hES media, directed differentiation with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin (IL)-3, and harvest of nonadherent monocytes from the culture supernatants. hES monocytes (esMCs) were analyzed by microscopy, flow cytometry, transcriptome analysis, and tested for the ability to differentiate into macrophages. hES monocyte-derived macrophages (esMDM) were analyzed for phagocytosis and endocytosis by microscopy and flow cytometry, cytokine secretion by multiplex cytokine assay, and for interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-4 activation by flow cytometry. Homogeneous esMCs (>90% CD14-positive) that did not require any additional purification steps were produced after 18.7 +/- 7.7 days (mean +/- SD, n equals 19). Production continued for several months when growth factors were replaced, with a total yield of 3.4 x 10(5) +/- 2.0 esMCs (mean +/- SD, n equals 9) per EB. Transcriptome analysis of the esMC and the esMDM revealed a distinct myeloid signature that correlated with primary adult blood-derived monocytes and spleen tissue samples but not with other tissue samples tested. We found that esMCs and esMDMs expressed well-defined markers of the mononuclear phagocyte system including PU-1, C/EBPalpha, EMR1, and EMR2, MPEG1, CD1c, CD4, CD18, CD32, CD33, CD68, cathepsins and serine carboxypeptidase. Finally, esMCs differentiated into functional macrophages that could endocytose acetylated low-density lipoprotein, phagocytose opsonized yeast particles, secrete specific cytokines in response to lipopolysaccharide, and be activated differentially with IFN-gamma and IL-4. We have developed a simple and efficient method for producing homogeneous populations of monocytes and macrophages from hES cells. esMCs have a myeloid signature and can differentiate into functional macrophages.

Molecularly, EMS is characterized by fusion of various partner genes to the FGFR1 gene, resulting in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinases in FGFR1. To date, no previous study has addressed the functional consequences of ectopic FGFR1 expression in the potentially most relevant cellular context, that of normal primary human hematopoietic cells. Herein, we report that expression of ZMYM2/FGFR1 (previously known as ZNF198/FGFR1) or BCR/FGFR1 in normal human CD34(+) cells from umbilical-cord blood leads to increased cellular proliferation and differentiation toward the erythroid lineage in vitro. In immunodeficient mice, expression of ZMYM2/FGFR1 or BCR/FGFR1 in human cells induces several features of human EMS, including expansion of several myeloid cell lineages and accumulation of blasts in bone marrow. Moreover, bone marrow fibrosis together with increased extramedullary hematopoiesis is observed. This study suggests that FGFR1 fusion oncogenes, by themselves, are capable of initiating an EMS-like disorder, and provides the first humanized model of a myeloproliferative disorder transforming into acute leukemia in mice.

The differentially expressed genes were grouped according to their reported functions, and correlations were sought with biological differences previously observed between the same groups. The most relevant findings include the following. (i) CML G0 cells are in a more advanced stage of development and more poised to proliferate than normal G0 cells. (ii) When CML G0 cells are stimulated to proliferate, they differentiate and mature more rapidly than normal counterpart. (iii) Whereas normal G0 cells form only granulocyte/monocyte colonies when stimulated by cytokines, CML G0 cells form a combination of the above and erythroid clusters and colonies.

Recent studies in mice suggest that changes within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population during aging contribute significantly to the manifestation of these age-associated hematopoietic pathologies. Though the mouse HSC population has been shown to change both quantitatively and functionally with age, changes in the human HSC and progenitor cell populations during aging have been incompletely characterized. To elucidate the properties of an aged human hematopoietic system that may predispose to age-associated hematopoietic dysfunction, we evaluated immunophenotypic HSC and other hematopoietic progenitor populations from healthy, hematologically normal young and elderly human bone marrow samples. We found that aged immunophenotypic human HSC increase in frequency, are less quiescent, and exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation potential compared with young HSC. Gene expression profiling revealed that aged immunophenotypic human HSC transcriptionally up-regulate genes associated with cell cycle, myeloid lineage specification, and myeloid malignancies.

We found that aged immunophenotypic human HSC increase in frequency, are less quiescent, and exhibit myeloid-biased differentiation potential compared with young HSC. Gene expression profiling revealed that aged immunophenotypic human HSC transcriptionally up-regulate genes associated with cell cycle, myeloid lineage specification, and myeloid malignancies. These age-associated alterations in the frequency, developmental potential, and gene expression profile of human HSC are similar to those changes observed in mouse HSC, suggesting that hematopoietic aging is an evolutionarily conserved process.

These age-associated alterations in the frequency, developmental potential, and gene expression profile of human HSC are similar to those changes observed in mouse HSC, suggesting that hematopoietic aging is an evolutionarily conserved process.

J;7002	7002	Lindstedt	J	blood plasmacytoid dendritic cell 1	Homo sapiens	blood pDC	CL:0000784		plasmacytoid dendritic cell			Lindstedt	"Human dendritic cells (DCs) are a distinct but heterogeneous lineage of APCs operating as the link between innate and adaptive immune responses, with the function to either maintain tolerance or trigger immunity. The DC lineage consists of several subpopulations with unique phenotypes; however, their functional characteristics and transcriptional similarities remain largely unknown. To further characterize the phenotypes and transcriptomes of the subsets, we purified myeloid CD16(+), blood DC Ag 1(+) (BDCA1(+)), and BDCA3(+) DC populations, as well as plasmacytoid CD123(+) DCs, from tonsillar tissue and peripheral blood. Transcriptional profiling and hierarchical clustering visualized that BDCA1(+) DCs clustered with BDCA3(+) DCs, whereas CD16(+) DCs and CD123(+) DCs clustered as distinct populations in blood. Differential expression levels of chemokines, ILs, and pattern recognition receptors were demonstrated, which emphasize innate DC subset specialization. Even though highly BDCA1(+) and BDCA3(+) DC-specific gene expression was identified in blood, the BDCA1(+) DCs and BDCA3(+) DCs from tonsils displayed similar transcriptional activity, most likely due to the pathogenic or inflammatory maturational signals present in tonsillar tissues.

The DC lineage consists of several subpopulations with unique phenotypes; however, their functional characteristics and transcriptional similarities remain largely unknown. To further characterize the phenotypes and transcriptomes of the subsets, we purified myeloid CD16(+), blood DC Ag 1(+) (BDCA1(+)), and BDCA3(+) DC populations, as well as plasmacytoid CD123(+) DCs, from tonsillar tissue and peripheral blood. Transcriptional profiling and hierarchical clustering visualized that BDCA1(+) DCs clustered with BDCA3(+) DCs, whereas CD16(+) DCs and CD123(+) DCs clustered as distinct populations in blood. Differential expression levels of chemokines, ILs, and pattern recognition receptors were demonstrated, which emphasize innate DC subset specialization. Even though highly BDCA1(+) and BDCA3(+) DC-specific gene expression was identified in blood, the BDCA1(+) DCs and BDCA3(+) DCs from tonsils displayed similar transcriptional activity, most likely due to the pathogenic or inflammatory maturational signals present in tonsillar tissues. Of note, plasmacytoid DCs displayed less plasticity in their transcriptional activity compared with myeloid DCs.

These are BCR‚ÄìABL1 kinase independent, refractory to apoptosis, and serve as a reservoir to drive relapse or TKI resistance. We demonstrate that Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 is misregulated in chronic phase CML LSCs. This is associated with extensive reprogramming of H3K27me3 targets in LSCs, thus sensitizing them to apoptosis upon treatment with an EZH2-specific inhibitor (EZH2i). EZH2i does not impair normal hematopoietic stem cell survival. Strikingly, treatment of primary CML cells with either EZH2i or TKI alone caused significant upregulation of H3K27me3 targets, and combined treatment further potentiated these effects and resulted in significant loss of LSCs compared to TKI alone, in vitro, and in long-term bone marrow murine xenografts. Our findings point to a promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy to more effectively target LSCs in patients with CML receiving TKIs. Significance: In CML, TKI-persistent LSCs remain an obstacle to cure, and approaches to eradicate them remain a significant unmet clinical need. We demonstrate that EZH2 and H3K27me3 reprogramming is important for LSC survival, but renders LSCs sensitive to the combined effects of EZH2i and TKI.

Transcriptional profiling and hierarchical clustering visualized that BDCA1(+) DCs clustered with BDCA3(+) DCs, whereas CD16(+) DCs and CD123(+) DCs clustered as distinct populations in blood. Differential expression levels of chemokines, ILs, and pattern recognition receptors were demonstrated, which emphasize innate DC subset specialization. Even though highly BDCA1(+) and BDCA3(+) DC-specific gene expression was identified in blood, the BDCA1(+) DCs and BDCA3(+) DCs from tonsils displayed similar transcriptional activity, most likely due to the pathogenic or inflammatory maturational signals present in tonsillar tissues. Of note, plasmacytoid DCs displayed less plasticity in their transcriptional activity compared with myeloid DCs. The data demonstrated a functionally distinct association of each of the seven subsets based on their signatures, involving regulatory genes in adaptive and innate immunity.
